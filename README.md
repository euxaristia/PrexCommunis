## Core Algorithms

### 1. Liturgical Calendar Determination

**Input:** Current date (month, day, year)

**Process:**

1. **Check Fixed Feasts First**
   - Dec 25 = Christmas Day
   - Jan 6 = The Epiphany
   - Other fixed feast days from saints calendar

2. **Calculate Easter (Computus Algorithm)**
   - Find ecclesiastical full moon: first full moon after March 21 (vernal equinox)
   - Easter = first Sunday after that full moon
   - Example: In 2026, Easter falls on April 5

3. **Derive Related Moveable Dates**
   - Advent Sunday = 4th Sunday before Christmas (earliest: Nov 27, latest: Dec 3)
   - Ash Wednesday = 46 days before Easter
   - Pentecost (Whitsunday) = 49 days after Easter
   - Trinity Sunday = 7 days after Pentecost

4. **Determine Liturgical Season**
   - **Advent** → Advent 1 to Dec 24
   - **Christmastide** → Dec 25 to Jan 5
   - **Epiphany** → Jan 6 to day before Baptism of Lord
   - **After Epiphany** → Baptism of Lord to Ash Wednesday - 1
   - **Lent** → Ash Wednesday to Easter - 1
   - **Eastertide** → Easter to Pentecost - 1
   - **Pentecost** → Pentecost to Trinity - 1
   - **After Trinity** → Trinity Sunday to Advent Sunday - 1

5. **Calculate Sunday Number Within Season**
   - Count Sundays from season start
   - Example: 2nd Sunday after Epiphany = 2 Sundays elapsed since Jan 6 or Baptism of Lord

**Output Example:** "The Second Sunday after Epiphany" or "Ash Wednesday" or "the Fifth Sunday in Lent"

**Liturgical Year 2026 Key Dates:**
- Advent begins: Nov 29, 2025
- Christmas: Dec 25, 2025
- Epiphany: Jan 6, 2026
- Easter: April 5, 2026
- Pentecost: May 24, 2026
- Trinity Sunday: May 31, 2026

**Source Code:** `app.js` → `getLiturgicalInfo()` function

### 2. Psalm Selection (30-Day Psalter Cycle)

**Input:** Current date (day of month: 1-31)

**Process:**

The 30-day cycle ensures all 150 Psalms are distributed across the month evenly, then repeats:

| Day | Morning Psalms | Evening Psalms |
|-----|----------------|-----------------|
| 1   | 1-5            | 6-8             |
| 2   | 9-11           | 12-14           |
| 3   | 15-17          | 18              |
| 4   | 19-21          | 22-24           |
| 5   | 25-27          | 28-30           |
| ... | ...            | ...             |
| 30  | 144-145        | 146-150         |
| 31  | 1-5 (repeats Day 1) | 6-8 (repeats Day 1) |

**Advantages:**
- Works consistently every month (no calendar confusion)
- Covers all Psalms regularly
- No need for moveable feast adjustments
- Common in Anglican tradition

**Output:** Array of psalm numbers (e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) with Latin titles and full Coverdale text

**Source Code:** `psalms.js` → `getTodaysPsalms()` function

---

### 3. Scripture Readings Selection

**Input:**
- Current date (month, day)
- Office type (morning or evening)

**Process:**

1. **Determine Day of Year** using month and day
2. **Index into lectionary data** (1662 BCP two-year cycle)
3. **Retrieve two lessons for the day:**
   - **First Lesson:** Usually Old Testament or Apocrypha
   - **Second Lesson:** Usually New Testament or Gospel
   - Each day, each office has unique readings

**Example Mapping:**
```javascript
lectionary[1][23] = {  // January 23
  morning: {
    first: "Genesis 32:22-32",
    second: "Matthew 13:24-53"
  },
  evening: {
    first: "Genesis 33",
    second: "Acts 14"
  }
}
```

**Reading Presentation:**
- Formatted as: "The First Lesson is written in the Book of Genesis, in the 32nd chapter, beginning at the 22nd verse."
- Full text fetched from **bible-api.com** in KJV
- Cached in browser's localStorage to minimize API calls (caches for 7 days)
- Each lesson includes:
  - Lesson title ("The First Lesson")
  - Intro formula with exact reference
  - Full scripture text
  - Closing: "Here endeth the First [or Second] Lesson."

**Lectionary Cycle:** 1662 BCP two-year cycle (repeats annually on Dec 31 → Jan 1)

**Output:**
- First lesson: { reference: "Genesis 32:22-32", verses: [full KJV text] }
- Second lesson: { reference: "Matthew 13:24-53", verses: [full KJV text] }

**Source Code:**
- Data: `lectionary.js`
- Fetching: `app.js` → `loadReadings()` function
- Display: `app.js` → `buildLessonHtml()` and `injectReadings()` functions

### 4. Collect Selection (Prayer of the Day)

**Input:** Liturgical season (from Algorithm 1) and Sunday number

**Process:**

1. **Parse the season string** to extract:
   - Season name (e.g., "after Epiphany", "Lent")
   - Sunday number (e.g., "2" for "the Second Sunday in Lent")

2. **Select from collects database** organized by season:

| Season | Sundays | Collects Available |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| Advent | 1-4     | 4 unique collects  |
| Christmastide | - | Christmas + Sundays |
| Epiphany | - | Epiphany proper + 6 after |
| After Epiphany | 1-6+ | Up to 6 collects |
| Lent | Ash Wed + 1-5 | Ash Wednesday + 5 |
| Easter | 1-6 | 6 collects |
| Pentecost | - | 1 collect |
| Trinity | - | Trinity proper |
| After Trinity | 1-26 | 26 unique collects |

3. **Special Cases:**
   - Saints' days use a general collect for that season
   - Fixed feasts have their own collects
   - Moveable feasts follow season precedence

**Example:**
- Today = Jan 23, 2026 (second Saturday after Epiphany proper, Jan 6)
- Season = "after Epiphany", Sunday number = 2
- Collect = Collects["epiphany"][2] = "O Lord, we beseech thee mercifully to receive the prayers of thy people..."

**Presentation:**
- Labeled "The Collect of the Day"
- Full traditional BCP text
- Followed by "The Second Collect, for Peace"
- Then optional "The Third Collect, for Grace" (in morning prayer)

**Output:** Full text of appropriate collect(s)

**Source Code:** `collects.js` → `getTodaysCollect()` function

### 5. Opening Sentences of Scripture

**Input:** Office type (morning or evening)

**Process:**

1. **Maintain separate collections** of 10 traditional sentences each
2. **On each load**, randomly select one using `Math.random()`
3. **Display with Biblical citation**

**Morning Prayer Sentences (10):**
- Hebrews 12:1-2 (looking to Jesus, author of faith)
- Ephesians 5:14 (Awake and arise from dead)
