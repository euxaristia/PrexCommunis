### 6. Rubrics (Instructional Text)

**Status:** ✅ **Public Domain**

Rubrics (the instructional text in italics/red that tells you how to conduct the service) are an integral part of the 1662 BCP. Examples include:

- They are instructional/functional text, not creative content
- They have been reproduced unchanged for 350+ years
- No copyright claim has ever been made on BCP rubrics
