                    And there is no health in us.<br>
                    But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us,<br>
                    spare thou those who confess their faults,<br>
                    restore thou those who are penitent,<br>
                    according to thy promises declared unto mankind<br>
                    in Christ Jesus our Lord;<br>
                    and grant, O most merciful Father, for his sake,<br>
                    that we may hereafter live a godly, righteous, and sober life,<br>
